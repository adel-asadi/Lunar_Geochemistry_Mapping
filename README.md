# Lunar_Geochemistry_Mapping
This is MATLAB Code to Generate Iron and Titanium Abundance Maps of Lunar Surface by a Hybrid of Machine Learning Algorithms.;
Firstly, you need to download the TIFF file of Clementine's UVVIS image from USGS website via the following link:;
https://planetarymaps.usgs.gov/mosaic/Lunar_Clementine_UVVIS_WarpMosaic_5Bands_200m.tif;
Then, please open the "main.m" file, and follow the expalnations within the script to run it.;
You will see all the regression results and two full maps of FeO and TiO2 across the lunar surface.;
